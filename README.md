# CheckIn
Project for a previous employer designed to handle user input through a custom GUI and write output to Excel files for recordkeeping purposes. Needs heavy revision.

**General Future Plans:**

*1. Change the template .xmls to .csv rows. No reason to have two data sources.*

*2. Locate the areas where I used throwaway variables. Make one Extinguisher class for all extinguisher parts and data, and get rid of the throwaway or single-use variables.*

*3. Fix my bizarre spacing.*

*4. Methods like control_KeyUp can be generalized. Delete the other methods with the same function from other classes, and just instantiate an object of a single class with those methods.*
